# Week 9 Lab

This weeks lab requires you to use the React Native Stack Navigation functionality to access multiple screens to capture and process data.
Although similar to the Swiper component the Stack Navigation will create a stack of screens, the current one being viewed is on the top of the stack.
As you move through the screens the screen previously being viewed is pushed back behind the current one on the Stack.
The stack navigation is more commonly used in examples found on the web and it integrates better with the phones UI using features such as the back button.
The goals for today's lab are:
- To use the Stack Navigation to access multiple screens
- To split up all the code into separate files which will allow better management of the code as it expands
- To adapt a hard-coded Picker list to use items from an array
-
